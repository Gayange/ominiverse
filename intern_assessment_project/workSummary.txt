Brief Summary

Initially, I had little to no experience with NestJS or Prisma, and working with DTOs and validation was entirely new to me. 
Setting up the authentication system with JWTs, integrating Bearer tokens into Swagger, and getting the automated Swagger token 
flow to work took a significant amount of time and was quite challenging. I also had to figure out the proper way to
use environment variables, moving from env.example to a working .env configuration, which after some trial and error, worked 
perfectly.

When I started Part 2 and initialized the basic CRUD functionality for Todos, testing everything in Swagger 
gave me a lot of insight into how DTOs and validation work. Part 4, which involved implementing filtering and sorting, 
required careful thinking about query parameters and edge cases. Finally, Part 5 required extensive polishing, documentation, 
and preparing test cases. This part took the longest, as I had to meticulously check validations, error handling, and 
ensure the responses were consistent and user-friendly. Additionally, I went back to Part 2 to enhance validations in more detail,
ensuring that the DTOs enforced proper rules for every field.

During the process, I experimented with match.decorator to implement cross-field validation—for example, trying to enforce that 
if a password is provided, the email must also be present. Although it didn’t work exactly as I intended at first, it gave me
a better understanding of custom validators and how DTOs in NestJS can enforce complex rules. Overall, this project was a huge 
learning experience in organizing code, writing proper validation, documenting APIs, and ensuring everything works reliably 
end-to-end.
